In 1910, <strong class ="fancy">we almost shut down</strong>, but then Brandon, the owner, came up with a new innovative way to frost the cupcakes.  Then in 1915, we became the number one cupcake store in the nation.  Now in 2017, <strong class="fancy">we've still kept that reputation.</strong></p>
